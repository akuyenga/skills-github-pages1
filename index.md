title: Learning through self-paced GitHub Skills tutorials.
---

<p>Welcome to my practice site </p>

My name is Madison (@akuyenga). I'm learning to make webpages for a fellowship experience. 
This practice page will be a great boost of confidence as I navigate the experience. 
<p> Right now I'm practicing 3 main things: </p>
   <ul>
     <li>writing in a specific language (i.e. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS)</li>
     <li>debugging in a specific language</li>
     <li>navigating GitHub</li>
   </ul>
   I'm having an <em>okay</em> time doign this work. It's one of the more challgenging things I've done this year.
